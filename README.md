# 09_softdev_listeners

Create an HTML/JS program with the following features:

+ An SVG container
+ 1 button: clear
+ Enable the following event listeners for the svg area:
    - (Do NOT put all of this in a single event listener.)
    - Clicking on a blank section of the svg area should create a circle at that position.
    - Clicking on a circle once should change its color. (No new circles should be added to the svg container.)
    - Clicking on a circle a second time should remove the circle and add a new one to the svg container at a random location.
